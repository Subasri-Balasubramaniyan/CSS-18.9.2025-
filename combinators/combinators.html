  <h1>Why Sleep is Essential for Your Health</h1>
  <p>This is the article which is done by the true story of unhealthy sleeping</p>
  <span>Introduction</span>
  <p>We all know that we need to sleep, but many of us don't get enough. In our busy lives, sleep can feel like a luxury, but it's actually a fundamental necessity for good health. Getting sufficient, quality sleep is just as important as eating well and exercising. </p>
  <p>When you consistently miss out on sleep, you can experience negative effects on both your physical and mental well-being. Short-term consequences include feeling tired and irritable, while long-term sleep deprivation can increase your risk of chronic conditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. </p>
